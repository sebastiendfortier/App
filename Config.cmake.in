# If C language is not enabled, the target MPI::MPI_C will not be created by
# the find-module for MPI, same thing for Fortran.  Since they are dependencies
# of App::App-ompi but the user may be using just C or just Fortran, we need
# to make sure both languages are enabled.
#
# If a user has already done find_package(MPI) then maybe we would need to do
# some extra work to ensure the find-module is reexecuted.
